# Getting Started With DevOps Jenkins

Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project.

Jenkins achieves continuous integration with the help of plugins:
 - GitHub (for source control)
 - Maven (for build management)
 - Selenium (for UI testing)
 - Ansible (for deployment)
 - and many more.
